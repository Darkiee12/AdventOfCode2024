# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This repository contains my solutions to the daily programming puzzles released during Advent of Code, an event that challenges developers to solve a new puzzle every day throughout December. 

I attempt to solve these challenges using **Rust**. ðŸ¦€

## Setup

To replicate my setup, clone the `.devcontainer` folder and follow the instructions to work within it. A DevContainer is a development environment that's reproducible across machines. You can [learn more about DevContainers here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

### Requirements:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [VS Code Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Once you have these tools installed, open the repository in VS Code, and it will automatically prompt you to reopen in the container. From there, you can start working on the daily challenges.
